                     <font face="aerial" color="white" size="5">
                       <p> In these pandemic years, we developed a lot.Corona taught us countless things. It has positive effect on us as well. One important thing is, it taught us ‘how to switch from real life to a virtual world’. Earlier WWW or Internet was a friend but now in pandemic it became our best friend. We can say that as it helps in all fields such as businesses, jobs, politics etc. All fields are now becoming virtual day by day.</p> 
                        
                        
                      <p>  We are now totally dependent upon our new best friend, WWW. There are several evidences which can show that WWW has become our best friend in this universal epidemic period. Some of them are, we can never imagine that we can do classes sitting at home and study online, but WWW had made it possible. Another example is that our room has now become our office or work centre as I observe many people including my father doing office work at only one room.</p>
                       <P> The full form of WWW is ‘World Wide Web’. As the name itself symbolizes, it is parallel to a huge web which had taken the entire world into its fist. Internet indirectly keeps us safe from Covid-19 as it has made all the things virtual because of which we don’t need to go outside. </P>
                       <P> Pandemic taught us that anything can be done by sitting at a corner of a room. Corona taught us about the importance of our best friend WWW in this pandemic period. </P>
                       <P> Stephen Hawking, one of the greatest scientists has quoted “We are all now connected to the Internet like neurons in a giant brain”. At this topic, Microsoft founder Bill gates says “The Internet is becoming a town square for a global village of tomorrow”.</P>
                        <P> Now I will talk about the fields one by one which has turned virtual.</P>
                        <P> ⦁	Education: In this period of time, government has closed the schools and shifted all our education online. All study materials are now available on Internet. If WWW was not there, all these things were not possible. For instance E books, Zoom, Meet, MS Teams etc.</P>
                        
                        <P> ⦁	Business: Now let's take a glimpse that how business field is affected by WWW. In this pandemic period, all the business halted. People began to lug their businesses to apps, websites and other networks. If they did not take this step, they have to suffer a heavy loss. As business field linked with WWW they obtained multiplied profit. They started giving discount to the items which bedazzled the customers.</P>

                      <P>  ⦁	Banking: Let's take a glance that how banking system was affected by epidemic. Now a days, banking was based on E system. As many banks have made their apps or websites, which made banking more secure. Money now can be transferred or withdrawn within a second easily. Some of these apps and websites are BOB, YONO, www.hdfcbank.com, www.icicibank.com and many more. </P>
                        
                      <P>  ⦁	News, Views and Social Media: In this period, we became more modernized as of earlier. Instead of purchasing newspapers, we can get news in the form of E-paper. We can also be able to know the views or suggestions of the individuals. Social media has a lot of catbird seats (advantages) as it update us by recent news, people’s imagination, their thoughts and suggestion and help us to show our hidden flair. Such social platforms are Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter etc.</P>
                        
                      <P>  ⦁	Entertaining Platforms : We are now bored due to staying at home and continuously fighting with corona for three years. For our amusement, WWW had made some interesting platforms such as YouTube, Tik Tok, Moj etc.</P>
                        
                      <P>  ⦁	Online Shopping: WWW has made all the things easier and faster which includes shopping. Government had closed the shops to prevent mob and rush. In this period, the importance of online shopping increased. To make their business more commercial, Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal, Myntra etc started giving discounts.</P>
                        
                      <P>  Significance, advantages and positive effect of WWW in this pandemic period is given above. This period helped and taught us to fight against any circumstances. It also helped in burgeoning our country and taught the consequences of our close friend, WWW. These days the Omicron cases are spreading widely. In this third wave of pandemic, Internet or WWW is once again ready to help us and with its help we will also triumph over this corona. So, now welcome our new best friend!!</P>
